# Detailed installation guide

## Installing Node.js
Start by downloading the Node.js installer from [their website](https://nodejs.org/en) and find the downloaded file on your computer. Once you find it, double click it to start the Node.js installer.

If nothing is said about a particular step it's safe to assume there's nothing particular that you need to do.

When you get to the step "Custom Setup" you will need to make sure you install the features "Node.js runtime", "npm package manager", and "Add to path".

The default options should be just fine.

Check the box to install tools for native modules on the next step.

Once the installer is done the command prompt will open asking you install the additional tools.

Click on the window and press any key to start the installation and then wait while it does its thing. You may get a popup asking if you want Windows PowerShell to make changes to your devices, which you should say yes to.

### Verifying your installation
open your command prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Windows search bar.

Type "node -v" into the command prompt and hit enter. If everything went right with the installation it should show you what version of Node.js you have installed
